# VoipMod

Creates VoipChannels for Squad and Team.<br>

You can set the PlayerVoipLevel (Squad, Team, Disabled).<br>
- If it is set to Team you will join squad and team voip channels.<br>
- If it is set to Squad then just squad.<br>
- And if it is set to Disabled then you won't join any Voip Channel.<br>

You can adjust some settings with BetterIngameAdmin:
 - Player VoIP Level
 - Default VoIP volume
 - (Un)mute players via scoreboard actions

The VoipMod itself provides everything via console commands:

The mod has no dependency, so players that use VU's prod branch (currently build 17487) can still join.<br>
But still: only players in dev branch can use VoIP.
